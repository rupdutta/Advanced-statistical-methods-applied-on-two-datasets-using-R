Multi-Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Network - OLS, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net Regularizations

This program consisted of two main parts (a) and (b). 
Part (a) involved predicting the per capita crime rate using the other variables in the Boston dataset. A multiple regression model was fitted to predict a response 
using all the predictors. Plots were also generated to support the assertions of the model's performance. I tried to improve models' performance with the help of 
regularization methods such as ridge, lasso and elastic nets. Part (b) involved choosing a real and publicly available dataset. 
''Automobile_dataset" was sourced on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php for statistical analysis using the same methods as used on the Boston Dataset. 
The same criteria were also used to analyze the results.
